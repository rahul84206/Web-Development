        <h2> Creation and Development</h2>
        <p id="description">
            In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting
            for a new superhero idea. He said idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books
            and desire to create a character with whom teenager could identify.As with the Fantastic Four, Lee saw an
            opportunity "to get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comics books.
